                        Hello my name is Ethan and I am currently in my first
                        year of studying a BScIT degree in Networking and
                        Security. I have a passion and lifelong interest in the
                        field of technology and computers, a desire to learn as
                        much as possible and to apply this to my studies and
                        future career opportunities.
